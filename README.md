## Description

Descent into madness is a tamagotchi-like game where you take care of an adorable virtual pet. You must keep your cat fed, healthy, happy and sane.
But things are not what it seems and your cat slowly descends into madness.

## Features

- **Virtual Pet Management**: Take care of an adorable virtual pet by managing its hunger, happiness, health, and sanity levels.
- **Dynamic Animations**: The pet's animations change based on its current state (idle, feeding, playing, cleaning, talking, changing).
- **Interactive Buttons**: Use buttons to feed, play with, and clean your pet.
- **Randomized Dialogue**: The pet talks with randomized sentences based on its sanity level.
  Audio Effects: Play audio effects like knocking and laughing during interactions.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- **Game Over and Revival**: The game ends when the pet's health reaches zero, but you can watch an ad to revive the pet.
- **State Management**: Uses MobX for state management to handle the pet's state and game logic.
